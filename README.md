# Dome Rendering 

During the 2018 Fall semester I took AR Deisgn for Cultural Heritage. During the class I worked to develop an interactive planetarium show in collaboration with the Museum of Innovation and Science (MiSci) in Schenectady , NY and Troy Middle School. For the project we created an immersive experience for middle school students to teach them about Harriet Tubman and her use of STEM and astronomy. To achieve this we gave our audience invisible infrared laser pointers that they could use to change how the story was taught. This worked to imbed them into the storytelling process. During the project I worked primarily in Unity and Python to develop the infrared laser pointers tracker as well as the program to warp the imagery onto the irregular dome at the museum. Furthermore I worked as a lead design document writer. Therefore I had a major say over the content of the show as well as how the team handled problems during development. 

This repo contains the Unity program we used to warp the imagery onto the irregular dome at MiSci. To warp the images we use several different cameras to create a fisheye affect. You can use the following key inputs to view our imagery and audio:
